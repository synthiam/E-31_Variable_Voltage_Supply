The Variable Voltage Supply is an OEM product from China LC Technologies. They provide reliable application circuits at a low cost. We've modified their LM2596 voltage display module to be more user friendly. We've added a 2 wire dupont input with reverse polarity protection and black &  red output wires with Alligator clips.

A unique feature of this reference design is that it is application ready! Simply plug-in the input connector into votlage source and use the variable output voltage at the alligator clips.

**Input voltage:** 4.1-37VDC

**Output voltage:** 1.2-37VDC

**Maximum Output Current:** 3A

**Dimensions:** 45.7 x 42.2mm
